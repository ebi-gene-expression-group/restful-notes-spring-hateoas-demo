= Restful Notes Spring Hateoas Sample

A RESTful web service for creating and storing notes.
It uses hypermedia to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.
Demonstrates using Spring REST Docs with MockMvc and https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas/[Spring HATEOAS].



== Building the Sample

You will need Java 17 to build the sample.
It is built using Gradle:

[source]
----
./gradlew build
----

As part of the build, files named `build/docs/asciidoc/api-guide.html` and `build/docs/asciidoc/getting-started-guide.html` are created.
They are produced using Asciidoctor and include snippets generated by the sample's tests using Spring REST Docs.
